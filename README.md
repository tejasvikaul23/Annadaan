In India, weddings, festivals, and corporate events collectively generate tons of edible food waste every day. While hunger and food insecurity remain pressing issues, there is a lack of systematic channels for efficiently redirecting surplus food to those in need.

To address this, the proposed platform serves as a digital bridge between food donors and recipients, using modern cloud technologies and mobile-friendly interfaces. Event hosts or caterers can register surplus food after an event. Local NGOs or charities receive real-time notifications about the available food and can arrange pickups through verified volunteers.

The platform leverages location-based mapping and data analytics to track and visualize donation trends, helping society minimize food wastage culturally and operationally in line with Indiaâ€™s sustainable development goals.
